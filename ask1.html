                <p>Charles Dickens was born on 7 February 1812 at 1 Mile End Terrace (now 393 Commercial Road), Landport
                    in Portsea Island (Portsmouth), Hampshire, the second of eight children of Elizabeth Dickens (née
                    Barrow; 1789–1863) and John Dickens (1785–1851). His father was a clerk in the Navy Pay Office and
                    was temporarily stationed in the district. He asked Christopher Huffam, rigger to His Majesty's
                    Navy, gentleman, and head of an established firm, to act as godfather to Charles. Huffam is thought
                    to be the inspiration for Paul Dombey, the owner of a shipping company in Dickens's novel Dombey and
                    Son (1848).</p>

                    <p>January 1815, John Dickens was called back to London and the family moved to Norfolk Street,
                    Fitzrovia.[15] When Charles was four, they relocated to Sheerness and thence to Chatham, Kent, where
                    he spent his formative years until the age of 11. His early life seems to have been idyllic, though
                    he thought himself a "very small and not-over-particularly-taken-care-of boy".</p>

                    <p>Charles spent time outdoors, but also read voraciously, including the picaresque novels of Tobias
                    Smollett and Henry Fielding, as well as Robinson Crusoe and Gil Blas. He read and reread The Arabian
                    Nights and the Collected Farces of Elizabeth Inchbald. At age 7 he first saw Joseph Grimaldi—the
                    father of modern clowning—perform at the Star Theatre, Rochester. He later imitated Grimaldi's
                    clowning on several occasions, and would also edit the Memoirs of Joseph Grimaldi. He
                    retained poignant memories of childhood, helped by an excellent memory of people and events, which
                    he used in his writing. His father's brief work as a clerk in the Navy Pay Office afforded him a
                    few years of private education, first at a dame school and then at a school run by William Giles, a
                    dissenter, in Chatham.Dickens worked at the law office of Ellis and Blackmore, attorneys, of Holborn
                    Court, Gray's Inn, as a junior clerk from May 1827 to November 1828. He was a gifted mimic and
                    impersonated those around him: clients, lawyers and clerks. He went to theatres obsessively: he
                    claimed that for at least three years he went to the theatre every day. His favourite actor was
                    Charles Mathews and Dickens learnt his "monopolylogues" (farces in which Mathews played every
                    character) by heart. Then, having learned Gurney's system of shorthand in his spare time, he
                    left to become a freelance reporter. A distant relative, Thomas Charlton, was a freelance reporter
                    at Doctors' Commons and Dickens was able to share his box there to report the legal proceedings for
                    nearly four years.This education was to inform works such as Nicholas Nickleby, Dombey and
                    Son and especially Bleak House, whose vivid portrayal of the machinations and bureaucracy of the
                    legal system did much to enlighten the general public and served as a vehicle for dissemination of
                    Dickens's own views regarding, particularly, the heavy burden on the poor who were forced by
                    circumstances to "go to law".</p>

                <p>
                    In 1832, at the age of 20, Dickens was energetic and increasingly self-confident. He enjoyed
                    mimicry and popular entertainment, lacked a clear, specific sense of what he wanted to become,
                    and yet knew he wanted fame. Drawn to the theatre – he became an early member of the Garrick
                    Club – he landed an acting audition at Covent Garden, where the manager George Bartley and
                    the actor Charles Kemble were to see him. Dickens prepared meticulously and decided to imitate
                    the comedian Charles Mathews, but ultimately he missed the audition because of a cold. Before
                    another opportunity arose, he had set out on his career as a writer. </p>

                    <p>In 1833, Dickens submitted his first story, "A Dinner at Poplar Walk", to the London periodical
                    Monthly Magazine. William Barrow, Dickens's uncle on his mother's side, offered him a job on
                    The Mirror of Parliament and he worked in the House of Commons for the first time early in 1832.
                    He rented rooms at Furnival's Inn and worked as a political journalist, reporting on
                    Parliamentary debates, and he travelled across Britain to cover election campaigns for the
                    Morning Chronicle. His journalism, in the form of sketches in periodicals, formed his first
                    collection of pieces, published in 1836: Sketches by Boz – Boz being a family nickname he
                    employed as a pseudonym for some years. Dickens apparently adopted it from the nickname
                    'Moses', which he had given to his youngest brother Augustus Dickens, after a character in
                    Oliver Goldsmith's The Vicar of Wakefield. When pronounced by anyone with a head cold, "Moses"
                    became "Boses" – later shortened to Boz.Dickens's own name was considered "queer" by a
                    contemporary critic, who wrote in 1849: "Mr Dickens, as if in revenge for his own queer name,
                    does bestow still queerer ones upon his fictitious creations." Dickens contributed to and edited
                    journals throughout his literary career.[44] In January 1835, the Morning Chronicle launched an
                    evening edition, under the editorship of the Chronicle's music critic, George Hogarth. Hogarth
                    invited him to contribute Street Sketches and Dickens became a regular visitor to his Fulham
                    house – excited by Hogarth's friendship with Walter Scott (whom Dickens greatly admired) and
                    enjoying the company of Hogarth's three daughters: Georgina, Mary and 19-year-old Catherine.

            <div id="message14" class="hide">
                <p>On 9 June 1865, while returning from Paris with Ellen Ternan, Dickens was involved in the Staplehurst rail crash in Kent. The train's first seven carriages plunged off a cast iron bridge that was under repair. The only first-class carriage to remain on the track was the one in which Dickens was travelling. Before rescuers arrived, Dickens tended and comforted the wounded and the dying with a flask of brandy and a hat refreshed with water, and saved some lives. Before leaving, he remembered the unfinished manuscript for Our Mutual Friend, and he returned to his carriage to retrieve it.</p>

                <p>Dickens later used the experience of the crash as material for his short ghost story, "The Signal-Man", in which the central character has a premonition of his own death in a rail crash. He also based the story on several previous rail accidents, such as the Clayton Tunnel rail crash in Sussex of 1861. Dickens managed to avoid an appearance at the inquest to avoid disclosing that he had been travelling with Ternan and her mother, which would have caused a scandal.[139] After the crash, Dickens was nervous when travelling by train and would use alternative means when available.[140] In 1868 he wrote, "I have sudden vague rushes of terror, even when riding in a hansom cab, which are perfectly unreasonable but quite insurmountable." Dickens's son, Henry, recalled, "I have seen him sometimes in a railway carriage when there was a slight jolt. When this happened he was almost in a state of panic and gripped the seat with both hands.</p>
                <p>While he contemplated a second visit to the United States, the outbreak of the Civil War in America in 1861 delayed his plans. On 9 November 1867, over two years after the war, Dickens set sail from Liverpool for his second American reading tour. Landing in Boston, he devoted the rest of the month to a round of dinners with such notables as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and his American publisher, James T. Fields. In early December, the readings began. He performed 76 readings, netting £19,000, from December 1867 to April 1868.[141] Dickens shuttled between Boston and New York, where he gave 22 readings at Steinway Hall. Although he had started to suffer from what he called the "true American catarrh", he kept to a schedule that would have challenged a much younger man, even managing to squeeze in some sleighing in Central Park.[142]</p>

<p>During his travels, he saw a change in the people and the circumstances of America. His final appearance was at a banquet the American Press held in his honour at Delmonico's on 18 April, when he promised never to denounce America again. By the end of the tour Dickens could hardly manage solid food, subsisting on champagne and eggs beaten in sherry. On 23 April he boarded the Cunard liner Russia to return to Britain,[143] barely escaping a federal tax lien against the proceeds of his lecture tour.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="message15" class="hide">
                <p>Dickens's approach to the novel is influenced by various things, including the picaresque novel tradition, melodrama and the novel of sensibility.According to Ackroyd, other than these, perhaps the most important literary influence on him was derived from the fables of The Arabian Nights.Satire and irony are central to the picaresque novel.Comedy is also an aspect of the British picaresque novel tradition of Laurence Sterne, Henry Fielding and Tobias Smollett. Fielding's Tom Jones was a major influence on the 19th-century novelist including Dickens, who read it in his youth and named a son Henry Fielding Dickens after him.Influenced by Gothic fiction—a literary genre that began with The Castle of Otranto (1764) by Horace Walpole—Dickens incorporated Gothic imagery, settings and plot devices in his works.Victorian gothic moved from castles and abbeys into contemporary urban environments: in particular London, such as Dickens's Oliver Twist and Bleak House. The jilted bride Miss Havisham from Great Expectations is one of Dickens' best-known gothic creations; living in a ruined mansion, her bridal gown effectively doubles as her funeral shroud.</p>
                <P>No other writer had such a profound influence on Dickens as William Shakespeare. On Dickens's veneration of Shakespeare, Alfred Harbage wrote "No one is better qualified to recognise literary genius than a literary genius"— A Kind of Power: The Shakespeare-Dickens Analogy (1975).Regarding Shakespeare as "the great master" whose plays "were an unspeakable source of delight", Dickens's lifelong affinity with the playwright included seeing theatrical productions of his plays in London and putting on amateur dramatics with friends in his early years.In 1838 Dickens travelled to Stratford-upon-Avon and visited the house in which Shakespeare was born, leaving his autograph in the visitors' book. Dickens would draw on this experience in his next work, Nicholas Nickleby (1838–39), expressing the strength of feeling experienced by visitors to Shakespeare's birthplace: the character Mrs Wititterly states, "I don't know how it is, but after you've seen the place and written your name in the little book, somehow or other you seem to be inspired; it kindles up quite a fire within one.</P>
                <p>Dickens's writing style is marked by a profuse linguistic creativity.Satire, flourishing in his gift for caricature, is his forte. An early reviewer compared him to Hogarth for his keen practical sense of the ludicrous side of life, though his acclaimed mastery of varieties of class idiom may in fact mirror the conventions of contemporary popular theatre.Dickens worked intensively on developing arresting names for his characters that would reverberate with associations for his readers and assist the development of motifs in the storyline, giving what one critic calls an "allegorical impetus" to the novels' meanings.To cite one of numerous examples, the name Mr Murdstone in David Copperfield conjures up twin allusions to murder and stony coldness.His literary style is also a mixture of fantasy and realism. His satires of British aristocratic snobbery – he calls one character the "Noble Refrigerator" – are often popular. Comparing orphans to stocks and shares, people to tug boats or dinner-party guests to furniture are just some of Dickens's acclaimed flights of fancy.</p>
                <p>The author worked closely with his illustrators, supplying them with a summary of the work at the outset and thus ensuring that his characters and settings were exactly how he envisioned them. He briefed the illustrator on plans for each month's instalment so that work could begin before he wrote them. Marcus Stone, illustrator of Our Mutual Friend, recalled that the author was always "ready to describe down to the minutest details the personal characteristics, and ... life-history of the creations of his fancy".Dickens employs Cockney English in many of his works, denoting working-class Londoners. Cockney grammar appears in terms such as ain't, and consonants in words are frequently omitted, as in 'ere (here) and wot (what). An example of this usage is in Oliver Twist. The Artful Dodger uses cockney slang which is juxtaposed with Oliver's 'proper' English, when the Dodger repeats Oliver saying "seven" with "sivin".</p>

                <p>
                    Dickens was the most popular novelist of his time,and remains one of the best-known and most-read of English authors. His works have never gone out of print, and have been adapted continually for the screen since the invention of cinema,with at least 200 motion pictures and TV adaptations based on Dickens's works documented. Many of his works were adapted for the stage during his own lifetime – early productions included The Haunted Man which was performed in the West End's Adelphi Theatre in 1848 – and, as early as 1901, the British silent film Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost was made by Walter R. Booth.Contemporaries such as publisher Edward Lloyd cashed in on Dickens's popularity with cheap imitations of his novels, resulting in his own popular 'penny dreadfuls'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the beginning of his career in the 1830s, Dickens's achievements in English literature were compared to those of Shakespeare.Dickens created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest British novelist of the Victorian era.His literary reputation, however began to decline with the publication of Bleak House in 1852–53. Philip Collins calls Bleak House 'a crucial item in the history of Dickens's reputation. Reviewers and literary figures during the 1850s, 1860s and 1870s, saw a "drear decline" in Dickens, from a writer of "bright sunny comedy ... to dark and serious social" commentary.The Spectator called Bleak House "a heavy book to read through at once ... dull and wearisome as a serial"; Richard Simpson, in The Rambler, characterised Hard Times as "this dreary framework"; Fraser's Magazine thought Little Dorrit "decidedly the worst of his novels".All the same, despite these "increasing reservations amongst reviewers and the chattering classes, 'the public never deserted its favourite'". Dickens's popular reputation remained unchanged, sales continued to rise, and Household Words and later All the Year Round were highly successful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As his career progressed, Dickens's fame and the demand for his public readings were unparalleled. In 1868 The Times wrote, "Amid all the variety of 'readings', those of Mr Charles Dickens stand alone."A Dickens biographer, Edgar Johnson, wrote in the 1950s: "It was [always] more than a reading; it was an extraordinary exhibition of acting that seized upon its auditors with a mesmeric possession."Juliet John backed the claim for Dickens "to be called the first self-made global media star of the age of mass culture."Comparing his reception at public readings to those of a contemporary pop star, The Guardian states, "People sometimes fainted at his shows. His performances even saw the rise of that modern phenomenon, the 'speculator' or ticket tout (scalpers) – the ones in New York City escaped detection by borrowing respectable-looking hats from the waiters in nearby restaurants."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Among fellow writers, there was a range of opinions on Dickens. Poet laureate, William Wordsworth (1770–1850), thought him a "very talkative, vulgar young person", adding he had not read a line of his work, while novelist George Meredith (1828–1909), found Dickens "intellectually lacking".In 1888 Leslie Stephen commented in the Dictionary of National Biography that "if literary fame could be safely measured by popularity with the half-educated, Dickens must claim the highest position among English novelists".Anthony Trollope's Autobiography famously declared Thackeray, not Dickens, to be the greatest novelist of the age. However, both Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky were admirers. Dostoyevsky commented: "We understand Dickens in Russia, I am convinced, almost as well as the English, perhaps even with all the nuances. It may well be that we love him no less than his compatriots do. And yet how original is Dickens, and how very English!"Tolstoy referred to David Copperfield as his favourite book, and he later adopted the novel as "a model for his own autobiographical reflections".French writer Jules Verne called Dickens his favourite writer, writing his novels "stand alone, dwarfing all others by their amazing power and felicity of expression".Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh was inspired by Dickens's novels in several of his paintings like Vincent's Chair and in an 1889 letter to his sister stated that reading Dickens, especially A Christmas Carol, was one of the things that was keeping him from committing suicide.Oscar Wilde generally disparaged his depiction of character, while admiring his gift for caricature.Henry James denied him a premier position, calling him "the greatest of superficial novelists": Dickens failed to endow his characters with psychological depth, and the novels, "loose baggy monsters",betrayed a "cavalier organisation".Joseph Conrad described his own childhood in bleak Dickensian terms, noting he had "an intense and unreasoning affection" for Bleak House dating back to his boyhood. The novel influenced his own gloomy portrait of London in The Secret Agent (1907).Virginia Woolf had a love-hate relationship with Dickens, finding his novels "mesmerizing" while reproving him for his sentimentalism and a commonplace style.
